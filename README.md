Welcome to my dotfiles
========

Just clone this repo **in your home directory** and execute the script with ```sh _install.sh```

You just have to change gitconfig with your name and email

<br>

The script will:

- Create a directory ~/dotfiles_old and move your current dotfiles that are in conflict with mine there

- Symlink all my dotfiles to your home directory

- Clone oh-my-zsh in your home directory (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

- Symlink my custom theme and plugin to the oh-my-zsh directory
